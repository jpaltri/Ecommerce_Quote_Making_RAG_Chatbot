# Culligan Quote-Making Chatbot

This project features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant designed to provide product information and quotes for Culligan's water filters, sinks, and related products. There are two versions of the chatbot: one that loads data from web links (`Culligan_web`) and another from a JSON file (`Culligan_json`). Both versions utilize advanced language models to deliver accurate and relevant information to customers.

## Features

### Memory Management
- **Session Management**: The chatbot uses a stateful approach to manage chat history, ensuring context is preserved throughout a user's session.
- **History Awareness**: The chatbot can reformulate user questions based on previous interactions within the same session, improving the relevance and accuracy of responses.

### User Interface
- **Custom Chat Profiles**: Users can select from different chat profiles representing various language models, allowing them to choose the model that best suits their needs.
- **Interactive Settings**: Users can customize their experience by selecting the model, enabling or disabling token streaming, and adjusting the temperature for response generation.
- **Predefined Starters**: The chatbot includes predefined starter prompts to help users quickly get answers to common questions related to Culligan products.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Document Integration**: The chatbot can load and process content from PDF documents, web links, or JSON files, using them as a knowledge base for answering user queries.
- **Advanced Retrieval**: The chatbot employs RAG techniques to enhance its responses by retrieving relevant information before generating answers, ensuring responses are both contextually relevant and backed by accurate data.

## Key Differences Between Versions

### Culligan_web
- **Data Source**: Loads data from web links.
- **Flexibility**: More convenient and flexible as it can fetch the latest information directly from the web.
- **Susceptibility**: More susceptible to hallucinations due to the variability and unpredictability of web content.

### Culligan_json
- **Data Source**: Loads data from a JSON file.
- **Accuracy**: More accurate and less susceptible to hallucinations as the data is predefined and controlled.
- **Convenience**: Less convenient than web scraping as it requires manual updates to the JSON file.
